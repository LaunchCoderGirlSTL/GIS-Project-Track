Appendix: Git and GitHub
========================

Git is the most widely-used version control system (VCS) among professional developers. VCS tools allow developers to collaborate effectively and keep track of changes to their code base.

GitHub is a web app used to host git repositories for collaboration. 

We will use git and GitHub in the final few lessons of this course. If these tools are new to you, keep reading to get acquianted.

Installation
------------

There are several ways to install git for each operating system. For Mac, the recommended method is to simply open a Terminal window and type ``git`` at the prompt. If git is already installed, you'll see a help message. If it is not installed, you see a prompt to install it.

On Windows, we recommend using `Git for Windows <https://gitforwindows.org/>`_. This includes the git command-line tool, as well as a useful terminal program called Git Bash.

Learning Git
------------

If you are completely new to git, you should start with an introductory tutorial. Our favorite is `Git-It <https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron#what-to-install>`_. Whereas many online tutorials have you use git in a fake, browser-based environment, Git-It teaches you git concepts using a real git install on your computer. Install Git-It by following the directions as the link above. You can skip the git and text editor install sections.

If you have used git before, but are looking for a refresher, read our `Git Cheatsheet <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/cheatsheets/blob/master/git-basics/README.md>`_. It includes the most common commands and scenrios for new developers, as well as links to additional resources.
