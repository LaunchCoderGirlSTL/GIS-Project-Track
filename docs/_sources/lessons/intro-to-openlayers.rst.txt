Intro to OpenLayers
===================

OpenLayers is an open-source JS library that provides tools for rendering and interacting with GIS data in the browser. You'll apply the learning on JavaScript from the last few lessons as you go through the official OpenLayers Workshop.

.. tip:: We recommend completing the workshop over the course of 3 weeks, specifically weeks 4-6 of this course. Setting that as a goal will keep your momentum up, and give you a solid, specific goal to strive for. 

Getting Ready
-------------

We'll need to understand a few additional concepts at a high level in order to use OpenLayers. Read the articles below, answering the questions listed as you go.

`What is Node and when should I use it? <https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/>`_ (through the "What is Node.js used for?" section)

`What is Webpack? <https://rachelscodenotes.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/js-questions-what-is-webpack/>`_

`Classes in JS (MDN) <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes>`_

Review Questions
################

* What is Node?
* What is Webpack? What kinds of tasks does Webpack carry out when incorporated into a project?
* How can you declare a class?
* How can you create an object from a given class?

OpenLayers Workshop
-------------------

Go through the `OpenLayers Workshop <https://openlayers.org/workshop/en/>`_ at your own pace, getting help from mentors and fellow learners as needed. 

Notes
#####

* As you're getting started on the tutorial, initialize the project directory as a Git repository. Commit your work at the end of each section.

* As you work through the workshop, you should **not** copy/paste the code. It can be tempting, but typing the code given by the workshop will give you a chance to think more fully about the classes and utilities being introduced, and they will "sink in" more fully.

* The OpenLayers Workshop introduces the *how* of OpenLayers more than the *what* or *why*. In other words, it guides you through creating front-end map-based applications while not going in-depth on the concepts of the library. We'll try to supplement the workshop with additional materials both within class and without. Here are a couple of additional resources to look at to help you understand the material you just went through:

`OpenLayers - Basic Concepts <http://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/tutorials/concepts.html>`_ - Read this overview of the core concepts of the OL library

`OpenLayers API reference <http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/>`_ - Familiarize with the basic layout and content of this site, so you can come back to it later as needed. Answer the following questions:

* When does the postrender event on a map fire?
* How could you add a logo to a map?
* What are the two render modes for vector layers?
