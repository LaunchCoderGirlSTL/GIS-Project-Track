JavaScript In The Browser
=========================

In this lesson, we'll explore how JS works in the browser to make dynamic web pages. 

Learning Objectives
-------------------

* Describe the two primary ways JS code can be included in an HTML page: via ``<script>`` tags and external files
* Describe the purpose of the Document Object Model (DOM)
* Use DOM methods to query and manipulate elements within a page
* Understand DOM events and how they can be handled with JS
* Use your browser's Developer Tools

Lesson
------

In class, we'll discuss the DOM at a high level. We'll also demonstrate how to use Firefox's Developer Tools to interact with the DOM. 

.. note:: If you are familiar with the Developer Tools of another browser (e.g. Chrome) then feel free to use that browser and it's tools. If you are completely new to JS and Developer Tools, we recommend installing `Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?icn=tabz>`_.
