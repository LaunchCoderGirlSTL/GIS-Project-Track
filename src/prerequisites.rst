Prerequisites
=============

This curriculum is designed to be doable by anyone with a basic understanding of procedural programming. If you know core concepts in a language like Python, Java, JavaScript, or C# then you're set. 

Specifically, we assume that you know these concepts:

* Variables and data types
* Flow control (loops and conditionals)
* Basic data structures like lists/arrays and maps/dictionaries
* Functions
* Basic object-oriented programming: creating classes and objects

If you have only taken a course like CoderGirls UX or SQL class, then you won't be ready to dive into this curriculum quite yet.
