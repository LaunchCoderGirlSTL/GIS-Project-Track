Setup
=====

The system requirements and software installs for this course are minimal.

System Requirements
-------------------

* Mac or Windows, with all OS updates applied
* At least 4 GB RAM (8 GB or more is preferred)
* At least 10 GB free hard drive space

.. note:: Everything in the curriculum should also work fine in most Linux distributions. However, the curriculum does not contain specific instructions or details for that platform, so Linux users may have to work through differences on their own.

Software
--------

If you don't have the following applications installed, go ahead and do so now. 

Code Editor
###########

You'll need a basic code editor such as `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ or `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_. Any editor that provides syntax highlighting for common languages will work just fine. A specialized IDE such as Visual Studio or IntelliJ is *not* appropriate for this curriculum. 

VirtualBox
##########

Later in the course, we'll set up GeoServer within a virtual machine. For this purpose, you'll need `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_.
