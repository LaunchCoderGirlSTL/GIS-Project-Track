Appendix: The Command Line 
==========================

Using a command-line interface (CLI) is an essential skill for any programmer. If you haven't encountered the command line yet, or if you want a refresher, check out the resources below.

What Is The Command Line?
-------------------------

The command line is a text-based interface that allows the user to type commands at a *prompt*. By typing in a command and hitting enter, the command executed by the operating system.

The command line is a powerful way to efficiently interact with a computer. For programmers, many tasks are much more efficient when using a command line. Additionally, some tasks are *only* possible when using a CLI.

Some terms often used as synonyms for the command line are: terminal, shell, and command prompt.

Command-line interfaces can vary from one operating system to another, so read up on the details for your OS.

Mac: The Terminal App
---------------------

Modern Mac (OS X) systems are Unix-like. This means that the built-in Terminal application works the same as does those on Unix or Linux (\*nix) machines. In fact, the Terminal app uses the most common shell program in us on \*nix systems, `Bash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>`_.

To learn or practice using Bash, complete the first 5 sections of the `Ryan's Linux Tutorial <https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/>`_. These cover the most essential operations that programmers will use on a regular basis.

The definitive reference (albeit a very verbose one) for Bash is the `Bash Reference Manual <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html>`_.

Windows: Command Prompt
-----------------------

There are multiple CLIs available for use, partly for historical reasons. The oldest Windows CLI still in use is called the *Command Prompt* or *cmd.exe* (after it's file name). It is the least Unix-like prompt on Windows systems, and while many prefer to use a more Unix-like CLI (e.g. Git Bash) most Windows programmers will have to use the Command Prompt from time to time.

.. note:: Microsoft more recently has released a more modern CLI called *Powershell*. 

For the purposes of this class, we'll use the Command Prompt. To learn about this tool, read `Windows Command Prompt in 15 Minutes <https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html>`_. The last two sections, "Redirection" and "Piping," are optional. 

The definitive reference for the Command Prompt is `Microsoft's Windows Commands article <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands>`_.
